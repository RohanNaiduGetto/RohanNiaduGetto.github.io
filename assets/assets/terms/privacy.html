share your information with certain Google Maps Platform APIs (e.g., Google
Maps API, Places API). Google Maps uses GPS, Wi-Fi, and cell towers to estimate
your location. GPS is accurate to about 20 meters, while Wi-Fi and cell towers
help improve accuracy when GPS signals are weak, like indoors. This data helps
Google Maps provide directions, but it is not always perfectly precise. We
obtain and store on your device (&quot;cache&quot;) your location. You may
revoke your consent anytime by contacting us at the contact details provided at
the end of this document.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-IN>In Short: If you choose to register or log

information about you.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-IN>Our Services offer you the ability to
register and log in using your third-party social media account details (like
your Facebook or X logins). Where you choose to do this, we will receive
certain profile information about you from your social media provider. The
profile information we receive may vary depending on the social media provider
concerned, but will often include your name, email address, friends list, and
profile picture, as well as other information you choose to make public on such
a social media platform.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-IN>We will use the information we receive only
for the purposes that are described in this Privacy Notice or that are
otherwise made clear to you on the relevant Services. Please note that we do
not control, and are not responsible for, other uses of your personal
information by your third-party social media provider. We recommend that you
review their privacy notice to understand how they collect, use, and share your
personal information, and how you can set your privacy preferences on their

long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Notice

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-IN>We will only keep your personal information
for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this Privacy Notice,
unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax,
accounting, or other legal requirements). No purpose in this notice will
require us keeping your personal information for longer than 12 months past the
termination of the user's account.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-IN>When we have no ongoing legitimate business
need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize
such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your
personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely
store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until
deletion is possible.</span></p>

reasonable technical and organizational security measures designed to protect
the security of any personal information we process. However, despite our
safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission
over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be
100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or
other unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our security and
improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although we will
do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal
information to and from our Services is at your own risk. You should only
access the Services within a secure environment.</span></p>
